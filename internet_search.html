                Many people rely on google search for medical advice, information, educational purposes and more. Without
                Google search, it would be difficult to gather information or to find specific things with ease. With that
                being said, search engines like Google didn't always exist in the past. The web used to look like page
                after page of long lists of texts. This had made searching for specific things hard and wasted countless
                time for many. The roots of internet search was first found at Stanford by two individuals, Jerry Wang and
                David Filo. They started a company together called Yahoo, that revolutionized web search. The thought struck
                upon them when they were playing a fantasy basketball league and had access to the web. They crunched data
                to trade players etc. Yahoo changed the perspective that there was no money to be made on the web. Advertising
                was first brought up on Yahoo where the founders thought that ads would disrupt their business. It was
                quite the opposite, as the users doubled and continued to double.

                Excite was another search startup competing against Yahoo. The company would basically crawl the web
                based upon a search term entered which was entirely different from Yahoo’s approach. Companies like Yahoo
                and Excite became portals for different things in the sake of advertising. However, despite all the
                innovations that were brough in, search wasn’t quite accurate yet. This is where Google came about to fix
                this main issue, with Sergey Brin and Larry Page taking the steed. Larry’s insight into search brought
                Google to where it is today. From his viewpoint, a page from one site to another can be thought of as a
                recommendation and thus link counting could be leveraged based upon the number of hits a site receives.
                These were the core model of Google’s success.

                    Despite Google’s advanced algorithm and search engine in place, a lot of companies and ventures didn’t
                    think Google could make it. However, they missed out on a deal of a lifetime as Google exploded later.
                    Google had no advertisements on their search engine at first. Later, they copied the design of advertising
                    properly. The design was composed of figuring what types of products visitors would search for and purchase
                    in the future. Keywords became very valuable for advertisers because of this and had become a money maker
                    for Google. Overture’s website which had all of this embedded in its site, would be key for Google to have
                    through monetization. Google had to copy Overture’s advertising algorithm after the deal with that company
                    failed. Thus, Google Ad Words were born where blue colored sponsored web links were treated as advertisements.
                    Google had ultimately changed the meaning of search in the past and its affects are still providing tremendous
                    amounts of profits to this day.

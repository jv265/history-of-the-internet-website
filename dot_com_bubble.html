            In the early day of the internet, no one could have imagined that it would slowly become the premiere
        platform for commerce. We simply love to spend and shopping reflects a primal decadence humans have in society.
        We can watch the very evolution of capitalism with each passing iteration of payment (trading livestock, gold,
        cash, and now using plastic), eCommerce is no different. Two of the most important purveyors in eCommerce were,
        and still are Amazon and eBay. These two companies have been around since the 90s and are part of an elite few
        that survived the Dot Com Bubble. The Dot Com Bubble can be boiled down to a “Boom, Bubble, Bust, and Revolution”.

            The Internet reached 50M users in just 5 years, while mediums such as radio took 38 years, and TV took 13
        years. The cycle that creates bubbles is usually caused by some new breakthrough technology and the ensuing rush
        of innovators and investors looking to cash in on their implementation. Netscape was the first to launch their
        IPO in 1995, a move seen by a lot as improbable, but extremely valuable to others. This IPO proved that
        companies revolving around Web technologies could be profitable after all.

            There was a lot of mistrust in eCommerce as a whole when it started to begin its upwards spiral of popularity.
        Consumers believed that malicious actors would be able to obtain their banking information, investment accounts,
        and credit card numbers. Public key encryption was developed after a team of researchers got together and
        brainstormed how they could secure consumer data efficiently, and near perfectly.

            Wall Street predictions of Amazon’s stock prices incited a frenzy of investors, inflating the cost of a
        share by 100% in just a few weeks. Since the Internet was slowly becoming more common, your average Joe could
        buy and sell stocks online, causing an uncontrollable madness of investors buying any stock that had a ‘.com’
        attached to it. This modern Gold Rush ended when Wall Street started pulling their money out of companies that
        simply were failing to deliver what was promised.

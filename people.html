            Communication changed vastly during the early growth of the Internet. The availability of home computers and
        dial up connections allowed anyone, anywhere to publish and share information freely. Rather than being
        well-connected to restricted outlets such as newspapers, publishers, and TV networks, new age platforms allowed
        the average Joe to share anything with the rest of the connected world.

            Platforms like YouTube gave big TV networks a run for their money by allowing anyone with a camera to simply
        point, shoot, upload, and share to a potential audience of millions. Facebook and other social media platforms
        allowed people to connect and form social networks like never before. Need to keep in touch with that old friend
        from your hometown? Why theyâ€™re just a search and message away.

            Music consumption in the early internet changed the way we listened to music forever. Giants like IBM spent
        millions of dollars in research with various record companies to see if consumers would burn CDs given the
        technology, they claimed that this would not be the case. However, with increasing record pricing, thrifty and
        clever consumers started to burn CDs onto their computers and save them as the newly formed and standardized
        digital music format, MP3. The advent of saving a single song as a MP3 file lead to early internet adopters
        rushing to file sharing programs such as Napster, to share their favorite singles and burn their own mixtapes.

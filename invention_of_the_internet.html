    Labeled as “the telecommunications infrastructure of the 21st century”, the internet has enabled millions of people
    who had access to a computer to communicate and connect virtually either through email or chat rooms. The Internet
    is a global network that provides computer-based communication. More emails are delivered via the Internet today
    than first class letters delivered by the post office. The Internet generates $3.1 billion in business and is
    responsible for 1/3 of US economic growth in 1998.

    Computer communication was the main attraction with the invention of the Internet as it was continuously being
    developed and improved through its many different stages of birth. Being able to message anyone, anywhere around
    the world at the click of a button was, and still is, a jaw dropping experience for many. This wouldn’t have been
    established if it weren’t for packet switching and hot potato routing. Packet switching was established so that
    messages were able to get transported to its desired location even if it failed occasionally. This was done by
    keeping copies of the message and sending it over and over as long as some part of the network is working. Along
    with this concept, hot potato routing allowed information to flow quickly without overloading a single system.
    Arpanet, which was how the internet started, was developed using packet switching to allow multiple computers to
    communicate on a single network. The data (information) is broken down into little tiny pieces called packets that
    are sent through the network. A single packet contains a header that tells it where it has to go and this is where
    nodes play a very important role. A node helps decide where to send each packet.

    Later, through the combination of Netscape and the World Wide Web, the Internet was more publicly available to
    the masses with Arpanet as its prototype. A protocol was also implemented called TCP/IP which allowed any computer
    to connect to the Internet, and is now the universal standard in developing the internet. A million-dollar
    investment had revolutionized our world as we know by allowing us to shop online instead of going to the store or
    chat with someone online rather than meeting in person.

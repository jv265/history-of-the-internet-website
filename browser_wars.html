    The web browser we all use every day to either search things we don’t know or watch videos on YouTube had come a
    long way before finally establishing itself. The world’s first publicly available web browser, and one of the many
    descendants of browsers was developed by graduates of the University of Illinois. The graduates were trying to get
    a good prototype of the browser before the competition with Microsoft grew stronger. That prototype was known as
    Mosaic. The browser was freely available to the mass market where it was only sent to 12 people at first, but then
    it got viral to the point that millions of users started using the browser just within 9 months.
</p>
<p>
    Mosaic was reborn as Netscape through a business venture between Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen. During that same
    period, Microsoft which had established itself as a monopoly in the PC operating systems space, wanted to take
    control of the internet and the whole computer industry. Microsoft perceived Netscape as a threat and deemed to
    put an end to the startup by making all PC’s everywhere have Microsoft as the centerpiece. Gates was very aggressive
    towards competition and took extreme measures to take down the hugely successful browser Netscape had developed. It
    was originally thought that the browser could take control over the whole OS which would render Microsoft’s OS
    completely useless. Everything seemed to go Netscape’s way until Marc Andreesen, one of the founders of Netscape,
    called Microsoft “a poorly debugged set of device drivers” which aggravated Gates and his employees. Thus, Internet
    Explorer was born to take on Netscape Navigator.

</p>
<p>
    Microsoft had a vast amount of resources and programming talent and a leader who was willing to break laws to get
    things done. Its engineers worked tirelessly to ensure their product was better but Gates ultimately decided to muster
    up a group of salespeople. Microsoft’s salespeople enforced Windows and Internet Explorer as the main OS and web browser
    respectively that consumers used when a new computer was purchased, instead of Netscape. However, the main differentiator
    between the two browsers was that Netscape wasn’t free but Internet Explorer was and had led to the downfall of Netscape.
    Microsoft’s Internet Explorer came out on top of the slated “browser wars” when AOL purchased Netscape. Gates later gave
    away his position to Steve Ballmer, a former friend, after pressure from the US government concerns over Microsoft’s
    marketing tactics and antitrust violations.
